# Product Store App

## A dynamic, responsive full-stack web application built with MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js (a.k.a. the MERN stack)

This project was built along with a [Youtube tutorial series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3BUHwfHf84) showing how to create a fully functional full-stack application. This course guides you through setting up your development environment, building a RESTful API, managing your database and developing an interactive frontend interface.

This web application allows the user to do the following:

* Create new products, both in the UI and the database;
* Edit or delete existing products, both from the UI and the database;
* Change the color theme of the website using a toggle button;

(Coming soon)
